# Can I make a game?
 First try with Unity3D and VR.

 What is necessary to create a VR game? I have absolutely no idea.
 This is a repository for my first try on Unity 3D + Oculus VR Headset following a tutorial series called "Introduction to VR in Unity" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGYtahQjmWQ&t=3s).
 
 As I am unsure on what I want to make in the end and as I have no experience with C#, take it easy when checking this project regarding best practices on the framework and language.
