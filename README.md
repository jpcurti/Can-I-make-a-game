# Lockdown Project: What is necessary to create a VR game?
First try with Unity3D, Blender and VR.

This is a repository for my first try on Unity 3D [V2020.1](https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual) + Oculus Quest VR Headset following a tutorial series called [Introduction to VR in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGYtahQjmWQ&t=3s) and Blender [V2.8.3](https://www.blender.org/download/Blender2.83/blender-2.83.5-windows64.msi/).
 
 As I am unsure on what I want to make in the end and as I have no experience with C#, take it easy when checking this project regarding best practices on the framework and language.


**Progress Preview**

**What is looks like in Unity:**

**Tasks for the game Base:**
- [x] Configure Project and create a plane and 3d scene objects
- [x] Configure user Input and XR Controller component + hand presence
- [x] Make a teleportation system
- [x] Implement Continuous movement, camera snap and gravity falling
- [x] Grab Interaction
- [X] Ray Interaction
- [ ] GUI to interact with the user somehow (maybe a menu to control some overall settings)


**Tasks for the game design:** 
- [X] Install a 3d Modelling SW such as blender and check some turorial like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIB5BrLgk68)
- [X] Make a simple model and import it to Unity like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8hHSBYGiJs) 
- [ ] Figure it out why some materials look ugly in unity (?) and deal with texture/ material baking (?)
- [ ] Animate a model and import it to Unity
- [ ] Haven't gone so far yet so what is the point here :)


**Cloning instructions:**
As the live preview (game window on Unity) using the Oculus quest is only possible with oculus link compatible platforms, this project will be done on a windows (w10-1909) machine. However it can be cloned into a Linux machine (The game can only be tested generating an .apk in this case).
